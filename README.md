# Project 1: Identifying Differential Gene Expression in Ischemic Atrial Pericytes vs Normal Atrial Pericytes: Possible insight on Pericytes role in Cardiac Diseases.
* We investigate differential gene expression of healthy atrial tissue pericytes versus atrial pericytes that suffered failing, end-stage ischemic heart disease. Raw RNAseq data of ischemic end-stage heart disease atrial pericytes and healthy atrial pericytes were filtered, edited, and analyzed to acquire differentially expressed genes. Functional analysis was then carried out on the 508 differentially expressed genes to categorize the genes functions. Of the 508 differentially expressed genes, 372 genes were upregulated and 136 were downregulated. The terms to describe the top 3 Gene Ontology (GO) sets are: 1.) extracellular region, 2.) homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules, and 3.) extracellular space. These findings may give insight into cardiac pericyte function and their pathophysiological role during ischemia.
